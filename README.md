# Phylogenetic  Clustering   

## Description

This is a working directory for the manuscript entitled "Phylogenetic Clustering of Origination and Extinction in North American Mammals throughout the Cenozoic". 
The overall goals of this project are to:

* Understand the degree to which mammalian faunal communities were phylogenetically clustered since the Late Cretaceous
* Evaluate these changes in step with large-scale climatic or ecologic changes in North America
* Compare the taxonomic relatedness of mammals with the magnitude of extinction and origination during these same intervals
